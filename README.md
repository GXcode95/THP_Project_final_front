# This application is our final project from The Hacking Project bootcamp

## It's called Playbox and it's a society game marketplace with a rent system.

This applicaiton is made with react as front-end frameworks, with a ruby on rails API back-end.

We used Material UI react component library to desgin our component faster.

We used cloudinary's API to handke our images.

It's available as a PWA, so you can install it on any desktop or mobile environment.

## Installation 

  - Download the front and back repository.

  - install the front with ` $ yarn install `
  
  - install The back with `$ bundle install`

  - create the db and run your migration with `$ rails db:create db:migrate`

  - You can fill the site with our seed with `$ rails db:seed`

As we use some extra services like sendgrid and cloudianry, you will have to setup environment variable with your own credentials.
